    Boid simulation built for Computer Animation (CPSC 589), taught by Dr.
    Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz at the University of Calgary, as part on an assignment.
    <br><br>
    Each boid follows a small set of rules that determine its behaviour based on that
    of its neighbours. A boid will move in teh same direction as its neighbours in a
    medium range, move away from its neighbours in a small range and try to match the
    direction of its neighbours in a large range. The result is an emergent
    behaviour that mimics ow swarms, flocks of birds, schools of fish and other large
    animal congregations behave.
