    Haptics are to the touch, what graphics are to the eye. I collaborated with Modan Han
    in a joint project for a special topics course in Computer Graphics (CPSC 599) taught
    by Dr. Sonny Chan.

    Our project consisted in calculating sphere-triangle intersections to deform 3D meshes
    based on the theoretical force a cursor would apply to these objects; and then render
    a feedback force of equal magnitude and opposite direction in the real world using
    a Novint Falcon haptic device.
