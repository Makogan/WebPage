    My honours thesis, conducted under Dr. Faramarz Samavati and with the Guidance of Troy
    Alderson at the University of Calgary. I studied how to extend Alderson's multi
    resolution scheme, which was suitable for spheres, to any arbitrary elliptical manifold.
    <br><br>
    By finding geometrical approaches to emulate spherical interpolation on ellipsoids
    the previous method could be adapted to new the topologies with no other modifications
    to the algorithm.
    <br><br>
    Ultimately we could, qualitatively, reduce or increase the number of points defining a
    closed curve in the surface of an ellipsoid while maintaining the general shape of the
    original curve.
