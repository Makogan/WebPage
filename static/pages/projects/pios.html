    A micro controller for the Raspberry Pi model 3, built from scratch as part of a

    Due to time constraints the 60 page report was not properly spell checked prior to
    submission and many spelling errors crept in, however the content itself remains
    useful for anyone interested in low level C/C++ or computer architecture.
