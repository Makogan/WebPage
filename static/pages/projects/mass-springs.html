    A physics simulation that models soft tissues as a graph of mass particles connected
    by springs following Hooke's law. Using Verlet integration as the underlying numerical
    method and acceleration structures, a large number of particles can be added to the
    model while maintaining simulation stability.

    Built as part of an assignment for Computer Animation (CPSC 587) taught by Dr.
    Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz at the University of Calgary.
