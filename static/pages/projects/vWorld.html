    I am interested in procedural asset generation. I built a 3D voxel terrain generation
    as a personal project to study Perlin Noise and large mesh computing optimizations.
    <br><br>
    The program computes an octave combination of Perlin Noise on the GPU to generate a
    height map, which is then used to create the terrain.
    <br><br>
    Only the triangles on the exterior of the terrain are visible, which allowed me to
    store the information of large volumes of terrain but dedicate GPU resources to only
    a small fraction of the total number of possible triangles.
