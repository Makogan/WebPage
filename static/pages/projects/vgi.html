    A rendering engine built from scratch, as a personal project in my own time,
    to explore and learn Voxel Global Illumination.
    I used C++ and OpenGL to implement a set of papers on how to achieve 3D rasterization
    with the GPU to create Voxel approximations of 3D geometry and store them in fast look up
    data structures.
    <br><br>
    This achieves a voxel approximation of the underlying geometry:

        <img src="static/images/sponza-blocks.png" style="height: 400px; width: 700px; object-fit: cover;">
    </div>

    Which works at custom levels of resolution:

    <div class="frame">
        <img src="static/images/drag1.png" style="height: 450px; width: 700px; object-fit: cover;">
    </div>

    <div class="frame">
        <img src="static/images/drag2.png" style="height: 450px; width: 700px; object-fit: cover;">
    </div>

    Its per-pixel efficiency can be improved with better data structures. In the following
    image a grey scale is used to visualize the per pixel iterations done by the GPU (white
    represents 100 iterations, black 0 iterations)

    <div class="frame">
        <img src="static/images/drag3.png" style="height: 450px; width: 700px; object-fit: cover;">
    </div>

    Which allows for real time rendering of illumination effects, such as soft shadows,
    by allowing for efficient data searches for collision detection.
